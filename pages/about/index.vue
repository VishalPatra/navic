          <p>
Evolve is an idea that brings current affairs and the future of communications in a melting pot of
discussions with students.
Every session, we start off with a discussion about the rawest developments in tech and communications.
Our goal is to fine tune it to 3 levels:
1. How does it affect you?
2. How does this affect your brand?
3. How does this affect media?</p> </b-col>

The best way to learn something is to do it. After a session of listening and discussion, it is crucial
that students try out the subject matter at hand with
hands-on experience. With an experiential testing mechanism that awards
creativity and exploration, students gain the most out
of 120 minutes of their day.</p> </b-col><b-col><img src="~/assets/about-rectangle.svg"></b-col></b-row>
