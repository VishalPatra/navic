          <p>
Evolve is an idea that brings current affairs and the future of communications in a melting pot of
discussions with students.
Every session, we start off with a discussion about the rawest developments in tech and communications.
Our goal is to fine tune it to 3 levels:
<br>1. How does it affect you?
<br>2. How does this affect your brand?
<br>3. How does this affect media?</p> </b-col>

              <h3 class="about-head alignleft">Part 3 - Method Learning</h3>
              <p>The best way to learn something is to do it. After a session of listening and discussion, it is crucial
that students try out the subject matter at hand with
hands-on experience. With an experiential testing mechanism that awards
creativity and exploration, students gain the most out
of 120 minutes of their day.</p>
